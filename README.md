# Dynamic Memory & File I/O Project

This repository contains the final project for the CIT 5930 course, focusing on dynamic memory management and file I/O operations in C. The project involves reading a .OBJ file created by PennSim, parsing it, and converting it back to assembly code.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to write a program that can open and read a .OBJ file, parse it, and load it into a linked list representing the LC4â€™s program and data memories. This process is known as reverse assembling or disassembling.

## File Structure

- `lc4.c`: Contains the `main()` function.
- `lc4_memory.c`: Contains linked list helper functions.
- `lc4_memory.h`: Contains the declaration of the `row_of_memory` structure and linked list helper functions.
- `lc4_loader.h`: Contains loader function declarations.
- `lc4_loader.c`: Contains .OBJ parsing function.
- `lc4_disassembler.h`: Contains disassembler function declarations.
- `lc4_disassembler.c`: Contains disassembling function.
- `Makefile`: Contains build targets for compiling the program.

## Requirements

- Codio platform or a similar C development environment.
- C compiler (gcc recommended).
- Make utility.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dynamic-memory-file-io.git
   cd dynamic-memory-file-io
   ```

2. **Compile the project:**
   ```sh
   make
   ```

3. **Run the program:**
   ```sh
   ./lc4 <object_file.obj>
   ```

## Usage

1. **Provide an .OBJ file:**
   The program takes an .OBJ file created by PennSim as input.

2. **Run the program:**
   ```sh
   ./lc4 my_file.obj
   ```

3. **Error handling:**
   If no file is passed, the program will output:
   ```
   error1: usage: ./lc4 <object_file.obj>
   ```

4. **Output:**
   The program will print the contents of the linked list representing LC4's memory.

## Implementation Details

1. **LC4 Loader:**
   - `open_file()`: Opens the .OBJ file specified by the user.
   - `parse_file()`: Reads and parses the .OBJ file, populating the linked list.

2. **Reverse Assembler:**
   - `reverse_assemble()`: Translates hex instructions into their assembly equivalents for OPCODE: 0001.

3. **Linked List Management:**
   - Functions for adding nodes, searching by address or opcode, and printing the list.

4. **Memory Management:**
   - The program ensures all dynamically allocated memory is freed before exiting.

## Testing

- Use `valgrind` to check for memory leaks:
  ```sh
  valgrind --leak-check=full ./lc4 my_file.obj
  ```

- Ensure `valgrind` reports 0 errors and no memory leaks.

This project was completed as part of the CIT 5930 course at the University of Pennsylvania. The primary goal was to enhance understanding of dynamic memory and file I/O operations in C programming.
